1. Note that Daniel Murphy is a common name so sometimes you get pictures of actors and such that are not baseball players. I will see if there is another parameter one can use to only get images from MLB.com using GiphyAPI.


3. A VERY fun assignment, API stuff is pretty neat 

4. Hope you feel GIFTastic when you are done with this
